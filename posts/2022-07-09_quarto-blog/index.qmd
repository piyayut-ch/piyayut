# Introduction
Quarto is an open-source software for rendering a plain text file into a veriety of formats (HTML file, MS word, etc.). It can execute code (python, R, julia) which means we can include code and also the output i.e. graph, table, and model results. This is perfect for technical writing. Please see more details on [Alison Hill's blog](https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2022-04-we-dont-talk-about-quarto/) or the [official website](https://quarto.org/).

Like [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), we can use Quarto to generate a website, blog or a book. In this post, I summarize minimal steps and workflow are needed to turn Quarto into a personal blog.

quarto has a file name `.qmd`

# Initial Setup
## Install quarto
Download the installer from this [link](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started). Then it should be straightforward to install. Then select your editor tools i.e. [VSCode](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/vscode.html) or [Jupyter](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/jupyter.html) or [Rstudio](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html)

## Create new project
create a project using bash command.
```bash
quarto create-project myblog --type website:blog
```

Note argument `--type website:blog` is used to create a folder with necessary files for a blog website. We will go and edit one by one.  

- `_quarto.yml` a config for whole website i.e. title, format, navbar 
- `index.qml` landing page.  
- `about.qml` about page.  
- `post` a folder post contains all posts.  
- `_metadata.yml` a metadata used for all posts.  


Preview the blog using bash command
```bash
quarto myblog preview
```

## Edit `_quarto.yml`
`_quarto.yml` is a yml config file for overall blog behavior. The defaults config is sufficient, but you can further customize and add functionality of your blog i.e. favicon, select search mode, customize navbar, add google analytics, etc. For greater details, please see official documents

- [https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-search.html](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-search.html)

```yml
# example
project:
  type: website

website:
  title: <TITLE>
  favicon: <PATH TO FILE>
  search: true
  navbar:
    right:
      - text: "About"
        href: about.qmd
      - icon: github
        href: <LINK>
``` 

## Edit `index.qmd`
`index.qmd` file at the root of project is a landing page for all blog posts. Basically it is a document or .qmd file with only metadata and no content. Please see [link](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html) for more details

```bash
---
# example of index.qmd
title: <TITLE>
listing:
  contents: posts
  sort: "date desc"
  type: default
  categories: true
  sort-ui: false
  filter-ui: false
page-layout: full
title-block-banner: true
---
```


## Edit `about.qmd`
`about.qmd` is a file for simple about page. We can change title, image, template social media link in metadata section. I suggest to put the image file in the same folder as .qmd file in this case is root of project. For template, there are 5 options to choose from jolla, trestles, solana, marquee, broadside. Choose one you like. Next edit your social media information i.e. twitter account, linkedin or github.

The body of about page i.e. desicription, education, work experience, skill, etc. can be edited as normal markdown file. See the [official document](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html) for more details.

```bash
# example
---
title: <TITLE>
about:
  template: jolla # jolla trestles, solana, marquee, broadside 
  image: profile.jpg
  links:
    - icon: twitter
      text: twitter
      href: https://twitter.com
    - icon: github
      text: Github
      href: https://github.com
---

Put all information as you need

## Education

## Work Experience

## Skill

```
## Edit `_metadata.yml`
`._metadata.yml` is yml file that will be used in every `.qmd` files under the same folder. This will be a good place to set global or common metadata. My personal preference is to set `title-block-banner: false`.



# Workflow

## Preview
we can preview our entile blog by running quarto cli command.
```bash
quarto <FOLDER> preview
```

I suggest to run this command when we resume working on the project. This is good for interactive purpose as quarto will rerender once you save the file and we can see the result in the browser. However, when it is ready for publish, you should use another commmand.

```bash
quarto <FOLDER> render
```

## Create a blog post
To add a new post  

- Create a folder in
- 


## Create new page
The default gives you two pages: blog listing page and about page. However, you can add new page i.e. projects or talk page by following:  

- Create a new folder at the root i.e. projects  
- Create a new `.qmd` file i.e. `projects.qmd`  
- Edit `.qmd` as a [listing page](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html) as you wish  
- Edit `_quarto.yml` to include the new page in navbar.  
- Create new project using `.qmd` file under the new folder. Similar to create a post.

```bash
# suppress the rest metadata for brevity
  navbar:
    right:
      - text: "Projects"
        href: projects.qmd
```


# Publishing
There are many options for hosting a blog as described in the [official document](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/publishing-websites.html). We use GitHub Pages approach.  

- render
- create .nojekyll
```bash
# windows
ni .nojekyll
# mac or linux
touch .nojekyll
```  
- asd
